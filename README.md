In this repo I sove all the 37 levels of the bandit game.

# You don't know what the Bandit game is?



The Bandit game is part of the OverTheWire wargames series, which are designed to teach players about security, system administration, and command-line skills in a hands-on way. The Bandit game is structured as a series of levels where players are tasked with finding "passwords" hidden on a remote server. Each level’s password is needed to access the next level.

Here’s an overview of how the game works and what to expect:

**Objective**: Players start at Level 0 and must progress through a series of increasingly difficult levels, each with a unique challenge. The goal is to find a password on each level that allows access to the next level. The tasks often involve searching for files, manipulating file permissions, using Linux commands, and understanding system behaviors.

**Learning Command-Line Basics**: Each level is designed to introduce specific Linux commands and concepts, such as:

- Navigating directories (cd, ls)
- Reading file contents (cat, more, less)
- File properties and permissions (chmod, chown)
- Searching and finding files (find, grep)
- Working with network connections and processes

**Accessing Levels**: Each level is accessed by SSH on a remote server. Players connect using SSH with a specific username (bandit0, bandit1, etc.) and the password from the previous level.

**Structure and Hints**: Each level provides hints and a list of suggested commands that might be useful for solving the challenge. This approach encourages players to explore and learn while building practical command-line skills.

**Problem-Solving Skills**: Beyond learning commands, the game also builds problem-solving skills by requiring logical thinking, understanding system files and directories, and knowing how different commands interact.

## Examples of Challenges:

- Basic file viewing and directory navigation.
- Extracting information from files with specific sizes, permissions, or ownership.
- Using network tools to interact with remote services.
- Reading compressed or encoded files.
- The Bandit game is well-suited for beginners to intermediate users who want to build a strong foundation in Linux, security, and system administration. It’s a great way to learn practical skills that are useful for both system administrators and security enthusiasts.
